  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    In order to use the energy from the Sun to generate electricity, there needs to be some method of harnessing the solar radiation. Since there is no fuel to burn to generate electricity like there is in fossil fuel power plants or nuclear power plants, different methods are used to capture or concentrate sunlight. There are two main methods: photovoltaic cells and solar thermal collectors. While solar thermal collectors are typically less complex, photovoltaic cells can be more useful as they directly transform solar radiation into electricity. See the interactive graph below for more statistics on solar power in the world.
