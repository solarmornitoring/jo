  <h2>solar energy이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>
    Solar energy</a> is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed <strong>using a range of ever-evolving <u>technologies</u></strong> such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.
    It is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power.

    </p><p style="margin-top:45px;"> Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
